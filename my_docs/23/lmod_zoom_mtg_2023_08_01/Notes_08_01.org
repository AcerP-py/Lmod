Notes on 15 Years of Lmod.

* My friend and colleague Bill Barth described that TACC was having.
** TACC used Tmod 3 (C/TCL based module system)
** They had a software hierarchy where loading a compiler modified $MODULEPATH
** Users then see the compiler dependent modules like Boost, MPI etc
** The trouble was that there was no easy way to switch compilers and/or MPI modules

* My key insight was that when $MODULEPATH changed to check and see if any modules needed to be unloaded or reloaded
** Looked at Env. Modules C/TCL based code and threw up my hands (AKA Tmod 3)
** There was no way I could modify that

* Decided to protype with Lua.
** The people who maintain Tmod 3
